My solutions for 2019's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)

## Usage

You must have a decently recent version of Elixir installed. Once that is done, simply run `mix aoc <day number>` (ie.: `mix aoc 1`) to execute that day's solution. Solutions executed are always the full solution of the day (aka setup for part 2 of the challenges).

You can also run `mix aoc <day number> --test <data>` (ie.: `mix aoc 1 --test 100756`) to try out specific input data instead of the full puzzle input.
